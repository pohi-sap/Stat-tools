## Get Help with this CLI tool or just look around ðŸ˜Š
```bash
python3 tx_statutes.py -h
```


# Quick start
This tool will get you all the text from a texas statute, you only need to specify [source](#sources) and statute info.

Texas statutes are searchable [here](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Index.aspx)

## Sources
Statute Sources are specified using two letters, case insensitive.
To get a current list of some, use:
```bash
python3 tx_statutes.py --list-sources
```

## Basic useage
By default, this thing will try and use a cache folder.
For example when you do this:
```bash
python3 tx_statutes.py --source tx --statute 11.1827
```
It will prompt with the following:
```bash
Existing statute cache folder not found
Do you want to create it now? ~38MB [Y/n]
```
If you type in `Y`, statute zip folders will be downloaded from 'https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Download.aspx' to ./statute_cache
```text
Creating cache, then continuing with searching for statute.

(b)  In addition to any other exemption to which the trust may be entitled, a community land trust is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of land owned by the trust, together with the housing units located on the land if they are owned 
by the trust, if:
(1)  the trust:
(A)  meets the requirements of a charitable organization provided by Sections 11.18(e) and (f);
(B)  owns the land for the purpose of leasing the land and selling or leasing the housing units located on the land as provided by Chapter 373B, Local Government Code; and
(C)  engages exclusively in the sale or lease of housing as described by Paragraph (B) and related activities, except that the trust may also engage in the development of low-income and moderate-income housing; and
(2)  the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by the body.
(c)  Property owned by a community land trust may not be exempted under Subsection (b) after the third anniversary of the date the trust acquires the property unless the trust is offering to sell or lease or is leasing the property as provided by Chapter 3
73B, Local Government Code.
(d)  A community land trust entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit under Subsection (b) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation by the taxing unit of any real or tangible personal property the trust owns and uses in the administrati

## HTTP
You can also do (an?/a?) http request instead of using cache.
This would be the done using the flag: `--query w`
```bash
python3 tx_statutes.py --source tx --statute 11.1827 --query w
```
